    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "There are three parts to this lab session. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A \"theoretical\" part: Given a set of training examples you have to decide on the architecture of the feed-forward neural network such as; number of layers, number of neuron per layers and finally the values of the weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. A \"programming\" part: Given the skeleton of the Python code of an MLP simulator, implement the missing functions (feedforward and backpropagation procedures). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. An \"experimental\" part: Having completed the implementation of the MLP simulator, the final step consist on training the network and testing its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Part 1: Design a neural network</h2>\n",
    "The aim of this part is to get a better understanding of the basics of Neural Networks construction. A number of sample points on a 128 by 128 grid have been assigned one out of three colors (red, green or blue). You should build a Neural Network with two inputs and three outputs which provides the exact coloring for these points. The problem can be visualized in the following figure: \n",

    "The file set30.x1x2rgb (in .\\data\\) contains the data corresponding to the problem defined above. The visual representation of the problem (above figure) is stored in data_set.jpg.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairs of x1 and x2 coordinates (both ranging between 0 and 127) are associated with a specific color: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Red: output 1 0 0, \n",
    "* Green: output 0 1 0, \n",
    "* Blue: output 0 0 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the network is to correctly determine for any given (x1, x2) coordinate pair the corresponding color. \n",
    "Your task is to <b>manually define a Neural Network which performs this task perfectly (do not forget to justify your answer)</b>. There is no need for programming or iterative training. The transfer function is assumed to be the step function: \n",
    "\n",
    "$f(t) = (t > 0)$ (it is equal to 1 if t is positive, 0 otherwise). \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it is your task to define the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the exact values for the weights. \n",
